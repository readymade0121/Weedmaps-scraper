Cloud Buster™ is crafted with uplifting cannabinoids and terpenes. Excellent for a morning boost or conquering that 3pm slump. Hints of tarragon and citrus.

Suggested Use
When cannabis is absorbed sublingually, or under the tongue, it simply works better. Traditional edibles, like brownies, gummies, and cookies, are often distorted by stomach acids and then broken down by the liver.

Sublingual cannabis products, on the other hand, are pulled straight into the bloodstream through the membranes in the mouth. Peel and discard the paper backing, place Slip under tongue and let dissolve. The onset only takes 10 minutes and the effects feel more like smoking than ingesting a traditional edible.

Available Dosages

☆Microdose | 5mg THC per Slip | 20 Slips per pack
